Sql Joins- when we have to extract data from two or more tables then we use the concept of join.
or Join is a query.

if we want to join two or more tables then we have one common column have holding same data with same or different column name.

types of join

i. unrestricted join
   a. when we are joining two or more tables without joining condition.
   b. cartesion product

   the Cartesian Product of sets A and B is defined as the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x belongs to A and y belongs to B. For example, if A = {1, 2} and B = {3, 4, 5}, then the Cartesian Product of A and B is {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}.

ii. restricted join
   a. when we are joining two or more tables with a join condition.
   b. return proper data
