The MySQL FROM Clause is used to select some records from a table. It can also be used to retrieve records from multiple tables using JOIN condition.
syn: FROM table1  
 [ { INNER JOIN | LEFT [OUTER] JOIN| RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN } table2  
 ON table1.column1 = table2.column1 ]

If we are using the FROM clause in a MySQL statement then at least one table must have been selected.

If we are using two or more tables in the MySQL FROM clause, these tables are generally joined using INNER or OUTER joins.
