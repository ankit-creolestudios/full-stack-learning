 OR condition 3. Mysql AND OR both

## In MySQL, we can use AND & OR condition both together with the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement.

## While combine these conditions, you must be aware where to use round brackets so that the database know the order to evaluate each condition

...  
OR condition

mysql>select \* from student where (product="mobile" OR id>0) AND year="2016"
