## Mysql uses a Drop Table statement to delete the existing table. This statement removes the complete data of a table along with the whole structure or definition permanently from the database.

## we cannot recover the lost data after deleting it

syn:mysql> DROP TABLE table_name;

    mysql> DROP TABLE  schema_name.table_name

## mysql>DROP TABLE student
