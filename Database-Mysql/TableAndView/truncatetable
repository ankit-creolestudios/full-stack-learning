Truncate statement in MySQL removes the complete data without removing its structure. It is a part of DDL or data definition language command.
syn:TRUNCATE [TABLE] table_name
Important:
We cannot use the WHERE clause with this command so that filtering of records is not possible.

We cannot rollback the deleted data after executing this command because the log is not maintained while performing this operation.
We cannot use the truncate statement when a table is referenced by a foreign key or participates in an indexed view.

The TRUNCATE command doesn't fire DELETE triggers associated with the table that is being truncated because it does not operate on individual rows.

Working:
RUNCATE command is more efficient as compared to the DELETE command because it removes and recreates the table instead of deleting single records one at a time

mysql>CREATE TABLE student (id int Primary key NOT NULL,name varchar(100) NOT NULL, product varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,country varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,year int NOT NULL)

mysql>INSERT INTO student(id,name,product,country,year) VALUES(1, "ankit","shorts",'india',2022),(2,'john','tv','usa',2016)

## mysql>TRUNCATE TABLE student
