## MySQL has a feature to create a special table called a Temporary Table that allows us to keep temporary data.

## We can reuse this table several times in a particular session.

## MySQL deletes this table automatically as long as the current session is closed or the user terminates the connection.

## We can also use the DROP TABLE command for removing this table explicitly when the user is not going to use it

syn:CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE table_name (  
 column_1, column_2, ..., table_constraints  
)

mysql>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Students( student_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL, total_marks DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00, total_subjects INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0)

mysql>INSERT INTO Students(student_name, total_marks, total_subjects) VALUES ('Joseph', 150.75, 2), ('Peter', 180.75, 2)
mysql>SELECT * FROM Students

## If we wants to create a temporary table whose structure is the same as existing table in the database, then the above statement cannot be used

syn:CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temporary_table_name SELECT * FROM original_table_name LIMIT 0
mysql>create temporary table employeetemp select * from employee limit 0
