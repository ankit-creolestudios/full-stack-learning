## Mysql copy or clone table is a feature that allows us to create a duplicate table of an existing table, including the table structure, indexes, constraints, default values, etc.

## Copying data of an existing table into a new table is very useful in a situation like backing up data in table failure.

## It is also advantageous when we need to test or perform something without affecting the original tables

syn: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS new_table_name  
 SELECT column1, column2, column3  
 FROM existing_table_name

mysql>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS new_table_name  
 SELECT column1, column2, column3  
 FROM existing_table_name

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS new_table_name  
 SELECT column1, column2, column3  
 FROM existing_table_name  
 WHERE condition

mysql>CREATE tABLE If NOT EXISTs studentInfos Select \* from student where year=2016

## It doesn't copy all dependent objects of the table, such as indexes, triggers, primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, etc. So the command of copying data along with its dependent object

syn:CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS new_table_name LIKE existing_table_name;INSERT new_table_name SELECT \* FROM existing_table_name
