1. mysql add column

A column is a series of cells in a table that may contain text, numbers, and images. Every column stores one value for each row in a table
MySQL allows the ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN command to add a new column to an existing table. The following are the syntax

syn:ALTER TABLE table_name  
 ADD COLUMN column_name column_definition [FIRST|AFTER existing_column]

mysql>ALTER TABLE studentInfo ADD COLUMN phone varchar(20) NOT NULL AFTER name

## multiple column add

syn:ALTER TABLE table_name  
 ADD COLUMN column_name1 column_definition [FIRST|AFTER existing_column],  
 ADD COLUMN column_name2 column_definition [FIRST|AFTER existing_column]
mysql>ALTER TABLE studentInfo ADD COLUMN phone varchar(20) NOT NULL AFTER name, ADD COLUMN pincode varchar(11) NOT NULL AFTER product

2. Mysql drop column

Mysql allows the ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN statement to delete the column from the table
syn:ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name

mysql>ALTER TABLE studentInfo DROP COLUMN phone

## mysql drop multiple table

syn:ALTER TABLE table_name  
DROP COLUMN column_1,  
DROP COLUMN column_2

mysql>ALTER TABLE studentInfo DROP COLUMN phone,DROP COLUMN name

3. Mysql show column
   Mysql column in the table are a series of cells that can stores text, numbers, and images. Every column stores one value for each row in a table

syn:SHOW COLUMNS FROM mytable_name FROM mydb_name
or
SHOW COLUMNS FROM mydb_name.mytable_name

mysql>show columns from studentInfo

## If we want to filter the columns of a table, we need to use the LIKE or WHERE clause in the statement

mysql>show columns from studentInfo LIKE "p%"

## If we want to display hidden column information, we need to add the FULL keyword to the SHOW COLUMNS statement

mysql>show full columns from studentInfo
type:It indicates the data type of each column.

Collation: It is used to sequence the order of a specific character set. Here it indicates the string column for non-binary values and NULL for other columns. We will see this column only when we use the FULL keyword.

Null: It indicates the nullability of a column. If a column can store NULL values, it returns YES. And if a column cannot store NULL value, it contains NO value.

Key: It indicates the indexing of the columns as PRI, UNI, and MUL. Let us understand this field in detail.

    If we have not specified any key, it means the column is not indexed. Otherwise, index as a secondary column in a multiple-column.
    If the column is specified as a PRI, it means the column is a PRIMARY KEY or one of the fields in a multiple-column PRIMARY KEY.
    If the column is specified as a UNI, it means the column contains a UNIQUE index.
    If the column is specified as a MUL, it means the column is the first column of a non-unique index where we can use a given value multiple times.
    If the column is specified by more than one key-value, this field displays the key which has the highest priority (the key priority is in the order of PRI, UNI, and MUL).

Default: It indicates the default value to the column. If the column includes no DEFAULT clause or has an explicit NULL default, it contains a NULL value.

Extra: It indicates the additional information related to a given column. This field is non-empty in the following cases:

    If the column is specified with the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute, its value is filled with auto_increment.
    If the column is specified with TIMESTAMP or DATETIME that have the ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP attribute, its value is filled with on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.
    For the generated columns, its value filled with VIRTUAL GENERATED or VIRTUAL STORED.

    If the column contains an expression default value, its value is filled with DEFAULT_GENERATED.

Privileges: It indicates the privileges that we have for the column. We will see this column only when we use the FULL keyword.

Comment: It indicates the comment that we have included in the column definition. We will see this column only when we use the FULL keyword

## Mysql describe statemen

syn:{DESCRIBE | DESC} table_name
mysql>describe studentInfo

4. Mysql rename column

syn:ALTER TABLE table_name  
 CHANGE COLUMN old_column_name new_column_name Data Type

All information of column attributes might not be available to the application for renaming.
There is a risk of accidental data type change that might result in the application's data loss.
